# ⚠️ Challenges Faced

1. Data Quality Issues:
The dataset contained missing values and duplicates that required significant cleaning efforts.Inconsistent entries, especially in pricing and currency, needed standardization.

2. Subjectivity in Ratings:
Customer ratings and reviews were subjective, introducing potential biases in the analysis.

3. Static Dataset:
The dataset represented a snapshot in time, limiting the ability to analyze ongoing trends or seasonal fluctuations.

4. Tool Integration:
Ensuring smooth integration between Python-processed data and Power BI was initially challenging, requiring multiple iterations for compatibility.

5. Geographical Limitations:
The dataset primarily covered metropolitan areas, leaving rural and suburban trends unexplored.
